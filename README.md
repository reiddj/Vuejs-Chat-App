# vuechat

> This is a mobile first front end messaging feed site created with vuejs. A user types in a message and it is simply outputed on the screen with a timestamp (not persisted to a database). The momentjs library was used to format the timestamp. Additional feature will be added such as data persistence, authentication, and support for uploading a profile pic.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
